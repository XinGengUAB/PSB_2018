1.) Rscripts and Data files - All data (gene lists, data matrices, functions and methods) to perform multinomial log-linear regression of TCGA BRCA dataset (105 patients).


2.) Modeling_Results_Key_Genes_Proteins_Evidence - Excel File containing tabs for individual results (performance metrics) for Imaging, Transcriptomics and Proteomics models. Details of Gene List overlaps with the data, final comparison between data modalities and independent literature evidence for many of the key genes and proteins and the associated cohort


3.) Details of CNN construction - Parameter and structure details of the various version of GoogLeNet employed

4.) Tabulated results from PRECOG analysis  - Results from the PRECOG database (precog.stanford.edu) associating the key predictive genes from the transcriptomics model to clinical outcome in breast cancer

5.) Details of model evalutation - Description of model building and evaluation for proteogenomics and histology image (CNN) based models
